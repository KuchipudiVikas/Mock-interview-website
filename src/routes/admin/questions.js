It will also enable you to optimization of component performance that will trigger deeper updates as it is permitted to pass the dispatch down instead of callbacks.</li>\n<li>\n<code>useMemo()</code> : This will be used for recomputing the memoized value when there is a change in one of the dependencies. This optimization will help for avoiding expensive calculations on each render.</li>\n<li>\n<code>useCallback()</code> : This is useful while passing callbacks into the optimized child components and depends on the equality of reference for the prevention of unneeded renders.</li>\n<li>\n<code>useImperativeHandle()</code>: \xa0It will enable modifying the instance that will be passed with the ref object.</li>\n<li>\n<code>useDebugValue()</code>: It is used for displaying a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.</li>\n<li>\n<code>useRef()</code> : It will permit creating a reference to the DOM element directly within the functional component.</li>\n<li>\n<code>useLayoutEffect()</code>: It is used for the reading layout from the DOM and re-rendering synchronously.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul><p><strong>2. Custom Hooks: </strong>A custom Hook is basically a function of JavaScript. The Custom Hook working is similar to a regular function.

Redux is very useful at a lower level of component hierarchy to handle the pieces of a state which are dependent on each other, instead of a declaration of multiple useState hooks.</p><p>In commercial web applications which is larger, the complexity will be high, so using only React Hook may not be sufficient. Few developers will try to tackle the challenge with the help of React Hooks and others will combine React Hooks with the Redux.</p>\n</article>' }, { 'question': '<h3> Explain conditional rendering in React.</h3>', 'answer': '<article class="ibpage-article">\n<p>Conditional rendering refers to the dynamic output of user interface markups based on a condition state. It works in the same way as JavaScript conditions. Using conditional rendering, it is possible to toggle specific application functions, API data rendering, hide or show elements, decide permission levels, authentication handling, and so on.</p><p>There are different approaches for implementing conditional rendering in React. Some of them are:</p><ul>\n<li>Using if-else conditional logic which is suitable for smaller as well as for medium-sized applications</li>\n<li>Using ternary operators, which takes away some amount of complication from if-else statements</li>\n<li>Using element variables, which will enable us to write cleaner code.</li>\n</ul>\n</article>' }, { 'question': '<h3> Explain how to create a simple React Hooks example program.</h3>', 'answer': '<article class="ibpage-article">\n<p>I will assume that you are having some coding knowledge about JavaScript and have installed Node on your system for creating a below given React Hook program. An installation of Node comes along with the command-line tools: npm and npx, where npm is useful to install the packages into a project and npx is useful in running commands of Node from the command line. The npx looks in the current project folder for checking whether a command has been installed there. When the command is not available on your computer, the npx will look in the npmjs.com repository, then the latest version of the command script will be loaded and will run without locally installing it. This feature is useful in creating a skeleton React application within a few key presses.</p><p>Open the Terminal inside the folder of your choice, and run the following command:</p><pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">npx create-react-app react-items-with-hooks</code></pre><p>Here, the <code>create-react-app</code> is an app initializer created by Facebook, to help with the easy and quick creation of React application, providing options to customize it while creating the application? The above command will create a new folder named react-items-with-hooks and it will be initialized with a basic React application. Now, you will be able to open the project in your favourite IDE. You can see an src folder inside the project along with the main application component <code>App.js</code>. This file is having a single function <code>App()</code> which will return an element and it will make use of an extended JavaScript syntax(JSX) for defining the component.</p><p>JSX will permit you for writing HTML-style template syntax directly into the JavaScript file. This mixture of JavaScript and HTML will be converted by React toolchain into pure JavaScript that will render the HTML element.</p><p>It is possible to define your own React components by writing a function that will return a JSX element. You can try this by creating a new file <code>src/SearchItem.js</code>and put the following code into it.</p><pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">import React from \'react\';\nexport function SearchItem() {\n return (\n   &lt;div&gt;\n     &lt;div className="search-input"&gt;\n       &lt;input type="text" placeholder="SearchItem"/&gt;\n     &lt;/div&gt;\n     &lt;h1 className="h1"&gt;Search Results&lt;/h1&gt;\n     &lt;div className="items"&gt;\n       &lt;table&gt;\n         &lt;thead&gt;\n           &lt;tr&gt;\n             &lt;th className="itemname-col"&gt;Item Name&lt;/th&gt;\n             &lt;th className="price-col"&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;\n             &lt;th className="quantity-col"&gt;Quantity&lt;/th&gt;\n           &lt;/tr&gt;\n         &lt;/thead&gt;\n         &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;\n       &lt;/table&gt;\n     &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n );\n}</code></pre><p>This is all about how you can create a component. It will only display the empty table and doesn’t do anything. But you will be able to use the Search component in the application. Open the file <code>src/App.js</code> and add the import statement given below to the top of the file.</p><pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">import { SearchItem } from \'./SearchItem\';</code></pre><p>Now, from the logo.svg, import will be removed and then contents of returned value in the function <code>App()</code> will be replaced with the following code:</p><pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">&lt;div className="App"&gt;\n &lt;header&gt;\n   Items with Hooks\n &lt;/header&gt;\n &lt;SearchItem/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>You can notice that the element &lt;SearchItem/&gt; has been used just similar to an HTML element. The JSX syntax will enable for including the components in this approach directly within the JavaScript code. Your application can be tested by running the below-given command in your terminal.</p><p><code>npm start</code></p><p>This command will compile your application and open your default browser into <a href="http://localhost:4000" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://localhost:4000</a>. This command can be kept on running when code development is in progress to make sure that the application is up-to-date, and also this browser page will be reloaded each time you modify and save the code.</p><p>This application will work finely, but it doesn’t look nice as it doesn’t react to any input from the user. You can make it more interactive by adding a state with React Hooks, adding authentication, etc.</p>\n</article>' }, { 'question': '<h3> How to create a switching component for displaying different pages?</h3>', 'answer': '<article class="ibpage-article">\n<p>A switching component refers to a component that will render one of the multiple components.
